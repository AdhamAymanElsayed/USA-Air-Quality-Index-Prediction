# USA-Air-Quality-Index-Prediction
AQI or Air Quality Index is the primary way to measure the current quality of the air. AQI values range from 0-500. AQI values are derived from moving averages/current values of PM2.5 (particulate matter), PM10, Ozone, Carbon Monoxide, Sulfur Dioxide, and Nitrogen Dioxide levels.

### Conclusion

- The majority of AQI ranges from 0 to 100 , Category 
- Most frequant category: good , then moderate
- Springfield is the most city has the number of testing
- Califorina is the most state has the number of testing
- Ozone is the most element affect AQI
- Top 5 years have High Average AQI  (1980,1983,1988,1981,1984)
- High AQI is in Summer months (June, July, August)
- All days are near in  Average AQI
- Riverside is the most city in california has high Average AQI
- Ozone is most effective parameter in summer months and CO is least effective parameter in Summer months 
- In California, most effective parameter in winter months is pm 2.5
